In this project I tested my abilities with the DOM and Bootstrap.

I made a responsive Shopping cart page that is compatible with all devices' screens using bootstrap, and used 
Javascript to make the page more responsive, for example:
	- Favourite button (the heart).
	- Delete button.
	- adding and removing quantities.
	- updating the total amount.
